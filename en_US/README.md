## Introduction

This is the repository of resources used in the **cipher** study group. To know more about it or how to contribute to it, consult its page in our [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/_paradigma/cipher/wikis/en_US/home) or come talk to us over [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!mTftlNrhXDxQHwFvET:matrix.org).

Tools are listed below firstly in order of priority and then by what we judge to be its *ease of use*. That is:

- **Easy:** no prior knowledge necessary

- **Moderate:** Some previous knowledge necessary. Were it not for that, it would be easy to use.

- **Hard:** Requires previous knowledge and its usage is complex.

- **Pending:** A tool recommended by various sources, bt pending review by the authors of this list.

Also, to simplify the compatibility description from the applications, we describe as:

- **Desktop:** Linux, MacOS and Windows

- **Mobile:** Android and iOS

- **All:** All of the Operational Systems listed previously plus the web browser.
